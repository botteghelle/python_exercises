TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'

It means that you are multiplying a string for a float. As the discussion here: 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/485789/why-do-i-get-typeerror-cant-multiply-sequence-by-non-int-of-type-float

Solution:  just convert the string to a proper format

i = 0 
if (df.at  [ i, 'Credit_Rating'].upper() == 'UNRATED') : print("a")

KeyError: 0

it seems that the sintax is regular... AND IT IS! only you do not have index 0 on that, 
in the end of the day: you have always to check at your indexes!

a smart correction just because in this case you want the first: 

i = min(UNRATED_BUT_SOLVENCY_RATIO.index)
if (df.at  [ i, 'Credit_Rating'].upper() == 'UNRATED') : print("a")
